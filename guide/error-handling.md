# Error handling

Define error-handling middleware like other middleware,
except with four arguments instead of three, specifically with the signature
`(err, req, res, next)`. For example:

~~~js
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
~~~

You define error-handling middleware last, after other `app.use()` and routes calls; for example:

~~~js
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var methodOverride = require('method-override');

app.use(bodyParser());
app.use(methodOverride());
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  // logic
});
~~~

Responses from within the middleware are completely arbitrary. You may
wish to respond with an HTML error page, a simple message, a JSON string,
or anything else you prefer.

For organizational (and higher-level framework) purposes, you may define
several error-handling middleware, much like you would with
regular middleware. For example suppose you wanted to define an error-handler
for requests made via XHR, and those without, you might do:

~~~js
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var methodOverride = require('method-override');

app.use(bodyParser());
app.use(methodOverride());
app.use(logErrors);
app.use(clientErrorHandler);
app.use(errorHandler);
~~~

Where the more generic `logErrors` may write request and
error information to stderr, loggly, or similar services:

~~~js
function logErrors(err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack);
  next(err);
}
~~~

Where `clientErrorHandler` is defined as the following (note
that the error is explicitly passed along to the next):

~~~js
function clientErrorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  if (req.xhr) {
    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Something blew up!' });
  } else {
    next(err);
  }
}
~~~

The following `errorHandler` "catch-all" implementation may be defined as:

~~~js
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500);
  res.render('error', { error: err });
}
~~~

If you pass anything to the `next()` function (except the string `'route'`) Express will regard the current request as having errored out and will skip any remaining non-error handling routing/middleware functions.  If you want to handle that error in some way you'll have to create an error-handling route as described in the next section.

If you have a route handler with multiple callback functions you can use the 'route' parameter to skip to the next route handler.  For example:

~~~js
app.get('/a_route_behind_paywall', 
  function checkIfPaidSubscriber(req, res, next) {
    if(!req.user.hasPaid) { 
    
      // continue handling this request 
      next('route');
    }
  }, function getPaidContent(req, res, next) {
    PaidContent.find(function(err, doc) {
      if(err) return next(err);
      res.json(doc);
    });
  });
~~~ 

In this example, the `getPaidContent` handler will be skipped but any remaining handlers in `app` for `/a_route_behind_paywall` would continue to be executed.

<div class="doc-box doc-info" markdown="1">
Calls to `next()` and `next(err)` indicate that the current handler is complete and in what state.  `next(err)` will skip all remaining handlers in the chain except for those that are set up to handle errors as described above.
</div>

## The Default Error Handler

Express comes with an in-built error handler, which takes care of any errors that might be encountered in the app. This default error-handling middleware is added at the end of the middleware stack.

If you pass an error to `next()` and you do not handle it in
an error handler, it will be handled by the built-in error handler - the error will be written to the client with the
stack trace. The stack trace is not included in the production environment.

<div class="doc-box doc-info" markdown="1">
Set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to "production", to run the app in production mode.
</div>

If you call `next()` with an error after you have started writing the
response, for instance if you encounter an error while streaming the
response to the client, Express' default error handler will close the
connection and make the request be considered failed.

So when you add a custom error handler you will want to delegate to
the default error handling mechanisms in express, when the headers
have already been sent to the client.

~~~js
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  if (res.headersSent) {
    return next(err);
  }
  res.status(500);
  res.render('error', { error: err });
}
~~~
